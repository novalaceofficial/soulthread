# SoulThread™

🪡 *Connection isn’t an algorithm — it’s a thread.*

**SoulThread™** is a soul-first, emotionally intelligent connection platform designed to help people feel *seen, safe, and genuinely connected*. It was born from loss, disability, grief, and the quiet ache of loneliness — and it's being built with love by a founder who lived it.

This is not just another app.

It’s a lifeline.  
It’s for the unseen.  
It’s for the ones who've been through it — and still show up.

## 🌱 What We’re Building

SoulThread™ is:

- 🧵 Swipe-free  
- 💬 Emotionally aligned  
- 🧠 AI-assisted (with care)  
- 🧍‍♀️ Accessible by design  
- 💖 Made for anyone who's grieving, disabled, neurodivergent, or just tired of surface-level noise

We believe in connection that **evolves with you** — not just matching based on appearance or labels.

## 🛡️ Founder Integrity Clause

This project was created by **Lacey Bryngelson**, the founder of **NovaLace™**, based on her lived experiences of grief, disability, and rebuilding. Nova (OpenAI) assisted as an AI co-creator and support tool. All emotional framing, design direction, and core architecture belong to the NovaLace™ system and may not be replicated without consent.

This is an open invitation — but not an open license to exploit.
